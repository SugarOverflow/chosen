### Chosen

Chosen is a library for making long, unwieldy select boxes more user friendly.

**I wanted to play around with some of the select box functionality.**

#### Documentation

You can check out all the information about Chosen @ http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/

#### Playground

I wanted to make a select box that contained links to other pages. 

This will serve as a very rough and basic functional prototype for a larger project.

A very simple implementation of an **onchange event** attribute of the <select> tag.
